          Krebit and any supported cryptographic token and blockchain could be
          impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action,
          which could impede or limit the ability of Krebit to continue to

          factors including but not limited to adoption, speculation, technology

          The value of Digital Assets may be derived from the continued
          willingness of market participants to exchange Digital Assets for Fiat
          currencies or other Digital Assets. If such willingness is abolished
          for any reason, this may result in the potential for a permanent and
          total loss of value of a particular Digital Asset.

        <p className="main-text">
          The volatility and unpredictability of the price of Digital Assets may
          result in significant loss over a short period of time. The nature of
          Digital Assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack,
          including rollback attacks or Blockchain reorganizations. The nature
          of Digital Assets means that any technological difficulties
          experienced by Krebit may prevent the access or use of your Digital
          Assets and/or cause losses of Digital Assets.

          Although Krebit takes precautionary measures to protect against cyber

          6.11 How KRB Token Rewards Are Calculated and Mint/Burnt
        </p>
        <p className="main-text">
          The Krebit Ethereum blockchain contract defines how the KRB tokens are
          mint/burn and all rules for the initial supply, rewards for
          registering Verifiable Credentials. Interacting with an Ethereum smart
          contract has transaction costs based on the Ethereum Blockchain gas,
          as well as any service fee defined by the smart contract definition.
          The definition for the KRB contract can be found in the
          “contract.krebit.eth” IPFS address.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">A) Verifiable credentials</p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          The first way to earn KRB token rewards is based on the Trust level
          that Issuer users give to your registered Verifiable Credentials in
          the platform, and the stake the Issuer defines in KRB tokens. Issuers
          can only stake up to the min/max KRB tokens balance in the contract.
          Rewards are based on the formula:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">[ KRB = Risked KRB * (Trust / Max Trust) ].</p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          Verifiable Credentials can be revoked by an Issuer, they can expire,
          and also be deleted by the credential subject. In all these cases both
          the issuer and subject rewards are also burnt.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          Any member can also dispute a Verifiable Credential via proposal on
          the Krebit DAO. Once raised, disputes must be resolved by voting and
          the rewards could get burnt and the verifier’s stake could get
          slashed.Once a dispute has been raised and settled one way or the
          other, the user on the losing side will lose reputation (slashed KRB)
          and the one on the winning side will gain it (minted KRB).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">B) DAO Participation</p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          A second way to earn KRB is by participating in the Krebit DAO, by
          creating proposals, with the formula:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          [ KRB = Risked KRB * (Up Votes - Down Votes) / Total Votes ].
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          If the result is positive, there will be that amount of KRB tokens
          minted and transferred to the proposer address. If the result is
          negative, the amount of KRB tokens will be burned from the proposer
          address.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          To combat voter apathy, each voter gets one KRB when they reveal their
          vote, regardless of the direction they voted in or the eventual result
          of the decision.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          This ‘payout regardless of opinion’ is to avoid us falling victim to
          the Keynesian beauty contest [4], in which due to receiving a reward
          for being “correct”, voters are incentivised to vote for what they
          believe most other people will vote for, rather than what they
          independently believe.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">C) Deal Reviews</p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          A third way to earn KRB is by participating in Krebit’s Marketplace.
          Krebit gives buyers the ability to rate sellers after completing a
          full transaction flow. If a buyer initiates a Escrow payment to your
          Deal in the marketplace, the formula will be:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">[ KRB = Risk KRB * Deal Fulfillment ].</p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          If the buying user marks the Deal as fulfilled successfully (Deal
          Fulfillment = 1), the total amount of risked KRB will be mint and
          transferred to your address. If the replying user marks the Deal as
          not fulfilled from your part (Deal Fulfillment = -1), then the total
          amount of risked KRB will be burnt from your address.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          If the buyer fails to complete or release the transaction, you can
          also dispute the Escrow in the DAO and get rewarded, while the buyer
          would be penalized. This way each party is rewarded based on its
          completion of its part of the Deal.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          Krebit rounds non-integer, rational numbers to the smallest possible
          decimal available for the applicable Eligible Digital Asset. If, at
          any time, for legal or other reasons, a Krebit Wallet is suspended or
          frozen by Krebit, Eligible Digital Assets connected to such Krebit
          Wallet shall not be eligible for rewards.
