        <p className="main-subtitle">2. What Type Of Information We Collect</p>
        <p className="main-text">
          We may collect two types of data and information from our Users. The
          first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable
          information pertaining to you, which may be made available or gathered
          via your use of the Services (“Non-personal Information“). We are not
          aware of the identity from which the Non-personal Information is
          collected. Non-personal Information which is collected may include
          your aggregated usage information and technical information
          transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware
          information about your device (e.g., the device you use, the type of
          browser and operating system your device uses, language preference,
          access time and the website’s domain name from which you linked to the
          Services, etc.), in order to enhance the functionality of the
          Services. We may also collect information about your activity on the
          Services (e.g., pages viewed, online browsing, clicks, actions,
          timestamps, etc.).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="main-text">
          The second type of information is individually identifiable
          information, namely information that identifies an individual or may
          with reasonable effort identify an individual (“Personal
          Information“). Such information may include:

            Account Information: When you sign-up and register to the Services,
            you will be asked to provide us certain details about yourself. You
            may register to the Services through your social network account or
            directly through the Application or our website (if applicable).

          <li className="main-text">
            Registering through the Application or our website (if applicable):
            When you register to the Services through the Application or our

            with regulatory Know Your Customer requirements, such as passport or

          <li className="main-text">
            Voluntarily Information: We may collect information which you

            communications from us, communicate with us via email or share
            additional information about yourself through your use of the
            Services. We may also collect the feedback, suggestions, complaints
            and reports which you send to us. Please note that we may also
            collect complaints about you from other Users, which may include
            your Personal Information.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="main-text">
          For the avoidance of doubt, if we combine Personal Information with
          Non-personal Information, the combined information will be treated as
          Personal Information as long as it remains combined.

            instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather
            reports or traffic news by using a cookie to store information about
            the region in which you are currently located, remember changes you
            have made to text size, fonts, and other parts of web pages that you
            can customize, and provide services you have asked for such as
            watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these

            and this information is shared with other organizations such as

          features of the Services may not operate properly and your online
          experience may be limited. We also use a tool called Google Analytics
          to collect information about your use of the Services. Google
          Analytics collects information such as how often users access the
          Services, what pages they visit when they do so, etc. We use the
          information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Services.
          Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date
          you visit sites, rather than your name or other identifying
          information. We do not combine the information collected through the
          use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.
          Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google
          Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google
          Analytics Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy.
